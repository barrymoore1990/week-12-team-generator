# Team Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

The motivation to build this project was so we can easily display our team information on a html web page. By doing it with prompts and rendering the file using Javascript, we saved a lot of work and potential mistakes. I learned a huge amount, including being able to return inquirer, and how to use multiple functions inside of it.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
